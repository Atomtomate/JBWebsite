# Overview
This is a fork of Gatsby's blog starter. 

During build of the website, several git repositories containing articles in markdown format are cloned. These are then parsed into blog entries. Additionally there is support for basic LaTeX using KaTeX as a backend.


## Setup
obtain sources: `git clone github.com/Atomtomate/JBWebsite`
obtain and install [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
cd into directory and use `gatsby develop` to spin up the development server. A version of this site should now be available at [localhost](http://localhost:8000)
